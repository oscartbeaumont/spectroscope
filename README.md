Test your [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) applications in style!

## Features:

- Simple

- Works with Electron security features enabled unlike [Spectron](https://github.com/electron-userland/spectron/issues/693)

## Basics

### Installation

```bash
npm install spectroscope
# Or
yarn add spectroscope
```

Installing Spectroscope as a dev dependency will cause issues with your final application unless the Spectroscope import is removed during your applications build process.

Follow the guide [here](https://github.com/oscartbeaumont/spectroscope/wiki/Installation) to add Spectroscope to your existing Electron application.
